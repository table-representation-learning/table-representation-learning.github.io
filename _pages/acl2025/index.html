            <b>Tables are a promising modality for representation learning and generative models with too much application potential to ignore.</b>
            However, tables have long been overlooked despite their dominant presence in the data landscape, e.g. data management and analysis pipelines.
            The majority of datasets in Google Dataset Search, for example, resembles typical tabular file formats like CSVs.
            Similarly, the top-3 most-used database management systems are all intended for relational data.

            Representation learning for tables, possibly combined with other modalities such as code and text, has shown impressive performance for tasks like semantic parsing,
            question answering, table understanding, data preparation, and data analysis (e.g. text-to-sql). The pre-training paradigm was shown to be effective for tabular ML (classification/regression) as well.
            More recently, we also observe promising potential in applying and enhancing LLMs in the domain of structured data to improve how we process and derive insights from structured data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Table Representation Learning (TRL) workshop is the premier venue in this emerging research area and
            has three main goals:

        <ul>
            <li> (1) Motivate structured data (e.g. tables) as a primary modality for representation and generative models and advance the area further. </li>
            <li> (2) Showcase impactful applications of pretrained table models and identify open challenges for future research, with a particular focus on progress in NLP for this edition at ACL in 2025. </li>
            <li> (3) Foster discussion and collaboration across the NLP, ML, IR and DB communities. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

                                    The rapid progress made over the last few years in generating linguistically coherent natural language has blurred, in the mind of many, the difference between natural language generation, understanding, knowledge retrieval and use, and the ability to reason with respect to the world. Nevertheless, reliably and consistently supporting high-level decisions that depend on natural language understanding and heterogenous information retrieval is still difficult, mostly, but not only, since most of these tasks are computationally more complex than language models can support. I will discuss some of the challenges underlying reasoning and information access and argue that we should exploit what LLMs do well while delegating responsibility to special purpose models and solvers for decision making. I will present some of our work in this space, focusing on supporting reasoning and information access.

                                    Electronic health records (EHR) contain a vast amount of medical records that can be leveraged for improving personal care as well as the operational aspect of medical institutions. Thanks to the introduction of LLMs and its remarkable advancement in recent years, we can now implement agents/services that can have complex interactions with the EHR via text-to-SQL, empowering the users to make more informed decisions than before. This, however, means the evaluation of such agents must also be complex and interactive, even multi-modal especially in the domain of medicine. In this talk, I will first briefly describe my view on AI evaluation, then introduce the basics of text-to-SQL for EHR, expand with multi-modal text-to-SQL, then conclude with interactive text-to-SQL for EHR.

                                    Large amounts of content both online and offline relies on structure to organize and communicate information more effectively. While natural image and language understanding and generation has been studied extensively, visually situated language such as tables, charts, plots, and infographics, continues to be a challenge for models large and small. In this talk we will show how teaching models to generate visually situated language can improve downstream reading and reasoning on this data modality for tasks such as question answering, entailment and summarization through multi-step reasoning and tool use.

            Please be aware that accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop in-person.

            <br>
            <h3>Formatting guidelines</h3>
            The workshop accepts regular research papers and industrial papers of the following types:
            <ul>
                <div class="col-xs-12">
                    <li>Short paper: 4 pages + references and appendix.</li>
                    <li>Regular paper: 8 pages + references and appendix.</li>
                </div>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            Submissions should be anonymized and follow the <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files" target="blank">ACL style files</a>, but can exclude the checklist.
            Non-anonymous preprints are no problem, and artifacts do not have to be anonymized. Just submitting the paper without author names/affiliations is sufficient.
            Supplementary material, if any, may be added in the appendix.
            The footer of accepted papers should state “Table Representation Learning Workshop at ACL 2025”. We expect authors to adopt an inclusive and diverse writing style.
            The <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html" target="blank">“Diversity and Inclusion in Writing”</a> guide by the DE&I in DB Conferences effort is a good resource.

            <br>
            <h3>Review process</h3>
            Papers will receive light reviews in a double-anonymous manner.
            All accepted submissions will be included in the workshop proceedings in the ACL Anthology, published on the website, and made public on OpenReview.

            <h3>Novelty and conflicts</h3>
            We encourage submissions on most recent work. The workshop does not accept submissions that have been published at ACL or other NLP venues as-is. We also welcome submissions that have been published in, for example, data management or machine learning venues.
            We rely on OpenReview for handling conflicts, so please ensure that the conflicts in every author's OpenReview profile are complete, in particular, with respect to the organization and program committees.

            Camera-ready papers are expected to express the authors and affiliations on the first page <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">and state "Table Representation Learning Workshop at ACL 2025'' in the footer.</span> <span style="color: green;">(The conference proceedings will add the appropriate footer.)</span>
            The camera-ready version may exceed the page limit for acknowledgements or small content changes up to 1 additional page, but revision is not required (for short papers: please be aware of novelty requirements of archival venues, e.g. SIGMOD, CVPR).
            The camera-ready version should be submitted through OpenReview (submission -> edit -> revision), and will be published on OpenReview, the ACL anthology and this website. Please make sure that all meta-data is correct as well, as it will be imported to the ACL website.

            <h3>Presentation instructions</h3>
            All accepted papers will be presented as poster during one of the poster sessions (the schedule per poster session will be released soon). For poster formatting, please refer to the poster instructions on <a href="https://ACL.cc/Conferences/2025/PosterInstructions" target="blank">the ACL site</a> (template, upload, etc), you can print and bring the poster yourself or print it locally through the facilities offered by ACL.
            <br>
            Optional: authors of poster submissions are also invited to send a teaser video of approx. 3 minutes (.mp4) to madelon@berkeley.edu, which will be hosted on the website and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCON8k4OzdrX9iswYIwb14jQ" target="blank"> YouTube channel</a> of the workshop.
            <br>
            Papers selected for oral presentation are also asked to prepare a talk of 9 minutes (+1 min Q&A), and upload their slides through the "slides" field in OpenReview (pdf) or share a link to Google Slides with madelon@cwi.nl. The schedule for the oral talks will be published soon. The recordings of oral talks will be published afterwards.
